\usage{
plotGCaMP_multi(FileFilter, genotype, cue = cue, food = OP50,
  startPulse = 30, endPulse = 60, center_on_pulse = FALSE,
  show.plots = TRUE, use.Fmax = FALSE, neuron = GCAMP, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{FileFilter}{string to search/subset filenames}

\item{genotype}{label the genotype for these data}

\item{cue}{label the stimulus cue.}

\item{food}{label to food cue}

\item{startPulse}{begin of stimulus}

\item{endPulse}{endPulse time of stimulus}

\item{center_on_pulse}{optional parameter to center delF values by the mean of the stimulus duration
1 = Bring values to mean delF of 2nd half pulse duration, order heatmaps by OFF responses (magnitude of increase)
2 = Bring values to mean delF of 2nd half pre-pulse duration, order by ON responses (magnitude of increase)
3 = Bring values to mean delF of 2nd half pulse duration, order heatmaps by OFF responses (magnitude of decrease)
4 = Bring values to mean delF of 2nd half pre-pulse duration, order by ON responses (magnitude of decrease)
'OFF' = Bring values to mean delF of 2nd half pre-pulse duration, order by OFF responses
'ON' = Bring values to mean delF of 2nd half pre-pulse duration, order by ON responses}

\item{neuron}{neuron being analyzed}
}
\description{
Function is a wrapper for exp.fit.all.log.lin which outputs corrected GCaMP signals as well as plots showing
original and corrected signals. Also plots average trace for GCaMP signal. Inputs are matfiles.
The script searches recursively for matfiles from a startPulseer file (can be any placeholder file). Need to exclude
matfiles that are not GCaMP files either using FileFilter, or by putting only relevant files in the folder.
Requires max_delta helper function
time etc...
